The game has four players (red, blue, yellow, green) or two players (red, blue), all players compete each other.

The objective of the game is to take all your tokens from the base to the end square before everyone.

Every turn starts by rolling the dice, then you can move one of your tokens by EXACTLY as many steps as the dice says

Rolling the dice again after moving a token:
if the dice face was 6, you are eligible to roll the dice again.
if there was another token in the square you landed on, you capture that square and you are eligible to roll the dice again.
if you manage to get on of your tokens to the end, then you are eligible to roll the dice again.

Special rules:
To move your tokens from the base, you need to roll the dice and get a 6.
There are safe squares in the game, where capturing is not allowed. These are the colored squares and the dark squares.
